# Operationalizing Machine Learning

In this project we will use the Microsoft Azure to configure cloud-based machine learning production model. We will use the Bank Marketing Dataset, then we will deploy it and consume it. Also, we will create, publish and consume the pipeline. This revolves around the best use of cloud based resources. We will perform the following steps after entering the workspace:

* Automated ML Experiment
* Deploy the best model
* Enable logging
* Swagger Documentation
* Consume model endpoints
* Create and publish a pipeline

## Automated ML Experiment
We create the new Automated ML Run Experiment and then upload the Bank Marketing dataset. We run the experiment using Classification and ensure that the best model explaintaion is enabled.
